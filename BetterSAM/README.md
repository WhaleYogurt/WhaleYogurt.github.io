# SAM Software Automatic Mouth

## What is SAM?

Sam is a very small Text-To-Speech (TTS) program written in C, that
runs on most popular platforms.

It is an adaption to Javascript of the speech software SAM (Software
Automatic Mouth) for the Commodore C64 published in the year 1982 by
Don't Ask Software (now SoftVoice, Inc.).

It is based on the adaption to C by
[Stefan Macke](https://github.com/s-macke/SAM)
and the refactorings by 
[Vidar Hokstad](https://github.com/vidarh/SAM) and
[8BitPimp](https://github.com/8BitPimp/SAM)

It aims for low memory impact and file size which is the reason I want
to avoid the 
[Emscripten conversion](http://simulationcorner.net/index.php?page=sam)
by Stefan (which weights about 414kb).

Any attempt to contact the company failed. The website was last
updated in the year 2009. The status of the original
